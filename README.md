### US Medical Insurance Costs: A Data Deep Dive

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

This project is an exploration into US medical insurance costs. My goal was to dig into a dataset to understand what factors most influence the price of health insurance for individuals. It's a great way to practice some data analysis skills and see what stories the numbers can tell.

I focused on a few key areas to find some interesting insights:

* **Age and Cost:** How does age affect your premium?
* **BMI and Charges:** Is there a relationship between body mass index and insurance cost?
* **Smoking Habits:** How much does being a smoker impact the cost? (Spoiler: A lot.)
* **Geographical Differences:** Do people in certain regions pay more than others?

This was a fun little project to get more comfortable with data analysis, and it was pretty cool to see how the different variables interact with each other. Feel free to check out the code and see for yourself!

*Tools used:* Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
